# VitalCare AI: User & Feature Documentation

## 1. Introduction

**VitalCare AI** is a modern, AI-powered health monitoring application designed to provide comprehensive care for patients, particularly the elderly. It serves as a central hub for patients, caregivers, and medical professionals to track vital signs, gain intelligent insights, and facilitate communication, ultimately enabling proactive and personalized healthcare.

The application is built using a robust frontend stack (React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS) and leverages the power of the **Google Gemini API** to deliver its advanced AI-driven features.

## 2. Core Features Overview

This document outlines the key functionalities of the VitalCare AI application, organized by its main sections: **Patient Dashboard**, **Caregiver Portal**, and **Video Consultation**.

### 2.1 Patient Dashboard

The Patient Dashboard is the primary interface for daily monitoring, offering a clear and immediate overview of the patient's health status.

**Key Functionalities:**

*   **At-a-Glance Vitals Monitoring:** Four interactive cards display the latest readings for Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Temperature, and O₂ Saturation. The cards dynamically change style to indicate active selection and use trend icons for quick assessment.

    > *Description: A screenshot of the top section of the Patient Dashboard, showing the four Vitals Cards for Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Temperature, and O₂ Saturation. One card should be highlighted as 'active'.*

*   **Interactive Historical Data Chart:** A detailed, zoomable, and pannable chart visualizes historical vital signs. Users can switch between different time ranges (24h, 7d, 30d) to identify long-term trends.

    > **ACTION: INSERT SCREENSHOT HERE**
    > *Description: A screenshot of the Vitals Chart component displaying a line graph for Heart Rate over the "Last 7 Days". The zoom and pan controls are visible above the chart.*

*   **Multi-Modal Data Entry:** To ensure ease of use, the app supports three methods for inputting new vital readings:
    *   **Manual Entry:** A straightforward form for typing in values.
    *   **Voice Entry:** Uses the browser's speech recognition and the Gemini API to parse spoken vitals (e.g., "Heart rate is 75, blood pressure 120 over 80"). The AI intelligently fills the form for user confirmation.
    *   **NFC Scan:** Leverages Web NFC to capture vitals instantly from a compatible medical device or tag.

    > **ACTION: INSERT SCREENSHOT HERE**
    > *Description: A screenshot of a composite image showing the three "Add Vitals" buttons: 'Manual Entry', 'Voice Entry', and 'Scan with NFC'.*

*   **AI-Powered Health Insights:** With a single click, caregivers can trigger an AI analysis of the patient's recent vitals. The Gemini API provides a concise summary and actionable, non-diagnostic recommendations based on the patient's data and medical history.

    > **ACTION: INSERT SCREENSHOT HERE**
    > *Description: A screenshot of the Health Insights section after analysis, showing the AI-generated "Summary" and "Recommendations" in distinct cards.*

### 2.2 Family & Caregiver Portal

This secure portal is designed for family members and caregivers to manage patient care remotely and collaboratively. It is organized into three intuitive tabs.

> **ACTION: INSERT SCREENSHOT HERE**
> *Description: A screenshot of the main view of the Caregiver Portal with the "Family & Caregiver Portal" header and the three navigation tabs: 'Overview', 'AI Smart Alerts', and 'Daily Log & Insights'.*

**Key Functionalities:**

*   **(Overview Tab) Medication Reminders:** Add, view, and manage medication schedules to ensure timely administration.

*   **(Overview Tab) Direct Communication:** A built-in chat interface for secure messaging between the caregiver and the medical team, ensuring everyone stays informed.

*   **(Overview Tab) Emergency Contacts:** A critical feature to add and manage emergency contacts. Each contact includes a **Quick Dial** button, which initiates a phone call on mobile devices for immediate action.

    > **ACTION: INSERT SCREENSHOT HERE**
    > *Description: A screenshot of the "Emergency Contacts" card within the Overview tab, showing a list of contacts with their details and the "Quick Dial" button.*

*   **(AI Smart Alerts Tab) Intelligent Anomaly Detection:** This feature goes beyond simple threshold alerts. It uses the Gemini API to analyze 7 days of historical data, establish a patient-specific baseline, and flag subtle but potentially significant patterns or deviations that would otherwise be missed.

    > **ACTION: INSERT SCREENSHOT HERE**
    > *Description: A screenshot of the "AI Smart Alerts" tab displaying a "Warning" or "Observation" alert generated by the AI, showing the finding and context.*

*   **(Daily Log & Insights Tab) Lifestyle Correlation Analysis:** Caregivers can log the patient's daily meals and activities. The AI can then analyze this data alongside vital signs to uncover potential correlations, such as how a specific meal affects blood pressure or how exercise impacts heart rate.

    > **ACTION: INSERT SCREENSHOT HERE**
    > *Description: A screenshot of the "Daily Log" tab showing the form to add a meal/activity and the "Correlation Insights" section displaying an AI-generated insight.*

### 2.3 Video Consultation

The Video Consultation screen simulates a live virtual visit between a doctor and the patient, enhanced with real-time data and AI-powered assistance.

**Key Functionalities:**

*   **Live Video Simulation:** Features a main video feed for the doctor and a picture-in-picture view for the patient's camera, creating a realistic telehealth experience.

*   **Real-Time Vitals Sidebar:** During the call, the doctor has constant access to the patient's live vital signs, displayed in both card and chart format. Vital cards will pulse red if a reading is outside the normal range, drawing immediate attention.

    > **ACTION: INSERT SCREENSHOT HERE**
    > *Description: A screenshot of the full Video Consultation screen. The main area shows the doctor's video, a small window shows the patient's video, and the right-hand sidebar displays the "Patient Live Vitals" cards and chart.*

*   **AI Consultation Helper:** A powerful on-demand tool for the doctor. By clicking the **"Get AI Consultation Summary"** button below the video, the Gemini API analyzes the patient's latest vitals and medical history to provide a concise summary. This includes key observations and suggested questions, helping the doctor be more efficient and insightful during the consultation.

    > **ACTION: INSERT SCREENSHOT HERE**
    > *Description: A screenshot showing the AI Consultation Helper in its active state. The button has been clicked, and an inline card is now visible below the video feed, showing the "Key Observations" and "Suggested Questions" from the AI.*
